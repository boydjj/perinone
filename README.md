Perinone
========

Perinone is a simple web application for handling art commissions.  It's not really an artist's gallery system, since there's about a billino of those.  Instead, this handles the details of being paid to make a piece of custom art for someone.  That includes:

1. Forms to ask the buyer necessary questions about the art.
2. A purchasing process that connects to Stripe or Paypal.
3. A WIP (Work In Progress) system so the buyers can see the progress of their commissions and interact with the artist as it's being worked on.
4. Works for only one artist at a time, not designed for multi-tenant hosting of many artists.  If you want it to work for lots of artists, run multiple instances of it.

Not much more than that, unless I need more.  Ideally this could work for any kind of commissioned product.  Guitar builds, graphic designs, furniture, but I'll start with paintings since that's what I need it for right now.

It's AGPL.  If you're in individual then go ahead and run it.  If you're a company you can forget about it.

Not that it mattes since it's not even close to ready to use yet.
